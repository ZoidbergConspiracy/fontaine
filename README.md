Fontaine is an attempt to make a comprehensive, automated RunBook for operations.

A good run book includes:

1. Documentation on architecture, including system inventory
   This should be synchronized with up-to-date state information

2. Documentation on procedures
   There should be a heirarchy of procedures, with generalized procedures that can
   be specialized for specific instances

3. Escalation and Contact Information
   Many procedures require special authorization or special skills, and the run book
   should make that clear

So what does that mean practically?

1a. A Wiki
1b. An inventory database
1c. Event management
1d. Automation to update wiki information based on states
1e. Visualization of architecture, inventory and states
1f. Discovery tools

2a. Business process flow design
2b. Business process flow management
